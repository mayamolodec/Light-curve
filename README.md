# Light-curve

This program was developed as part of my thesis work to study how the shape of a symbiotic star system's light curve depends on various parameters, such as the Roche-lobe filling parameter, orbital inclination, stellar atmosphere model and others.

The program simulates the rotation of a binary symbiotic system, the shape of the Roche-lobe potential, surface flux and temperature of the stars, and finally, the resulting light curve under different conditions.
